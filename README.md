# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O


## Bubble sort

Bubble sort repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, moving the largest unsorted element to its correct position in each pass. Despite its simplicity, it is inefficient for large lists and is primarily used for educational purposes.

## Insertion sort
Insertion sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time by iteratively placing each element in its correct position among the already sorted elements. It has an average and worst-case time complexity of 
O
(
n
2
)
O(n 
2
 ), making it less efficient than more advanced algorithms like quicksort or merge sort for large datasets. However, it performs well for small datasets or nearly sorted arrays due to its simple implementation and low overhead.
